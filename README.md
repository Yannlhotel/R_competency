# Machine Learning with R

This repository contains the content of the Machine Learning II course using R.  
The course covers various aspects of machine learning, including:


1. **Handling Missing Data**
   - `01_MissingData.R`

2. **Bayesian Classification**
   - `02_1_Bayes_functions.R`
   - `02_2_LDA_QDA_Diabetes.R`
   - `02_Bayes_functions.R`

3. **Classification and Miscellaneous Analyses**
   - `03_NB_Iris.R` - Naive Bayes classification on the Iris dataset  
   - `03_QuitJob.R` - Employee attrition analysis  
   - `03_Titanic.R` - Analysis of the Titanic dataset

4. **Support Vector Machines**
   - `04_SVC_College.R` - SVM applied to the College dataset  
   - `04_test_and_run.R` - Testing and execution  
   - `05_Non_linear_SVM.R` - Implementation of SVM with a non-linear kernel
   

To run these R scripts, you need:
- R and RStudio


### Python

The `Py_Code_bmo/` folder contains an SVM developed quickly using online resources to better understand how SVMs work:
- `prediction.py`
- `svm.py`

To run these scripts, all required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
